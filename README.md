# Description: This code can be played as a game like Gess.
# For rules of the game Gess, visit: https://www.chessvariants.com/crossover.dir/gess.html
# This game is usually played on a the squares of an 18x18 grid of a Go board using standard Go stones,
# But here, we use 2-dimensional arrays to portray a board and use 'B' and 'W' to represent the stones and '-' to
# represent an empty block. To play, you can use the make_move function by inputting coordinates as parameters.
# For example, game.make_move('e14', 'g14').
# This code contains only one class that contains all the methods for the mechanics of this game
# and contains all the private data members of the board.
